		<h2>Sitemap</h2>
		<p>One scrolling page</p>
		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>This is my professional site and kind of like an
		digital and interactive business card. Content will
		be brief and witty, expecting the design elements
		to engage the user. Project links are dynamic and have
		descriptive content. Would like to incorporate a payment
		button, mostly to go along with the classic arcade game
		theme I have planned for the project.</p>
		<h2>Interaction Flow</h2>
		<p>The user wants to know more about me, they are
		direct to my site. They should be able to scroll quickly
		down the one page to obtain this information.
