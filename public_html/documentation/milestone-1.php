		<h1>Purpose</h1>
		<p>The purpose of my personal website is to promote myself as an entry-level<br>
			jr developer; it should be a demonstration of my skill set.
		</p>
		<h1>Audience</h1>
		<p>The intended audience is employers and recruiters, directed here from my<br>
			linkedin profile.
		</p>
		<h1>Goal</h1>
		<p>The goal of this web page is to enhance my overall porfolio and land me a job.
		</p>
		<h1>Persona</h1>
		<p>Name: Sally Doolittle</p>
		<p>Sally works in Human Resourses for a web development firm, or she is headhunter.<br>
			She searched linkedin for keywords and found my profile, which direced her to this<br>
			site. She is skeptical of someone with no professional experience, but my resume <br>
			and porfolio are so badass, she gives me a call anyways.
		</p>
		<h1>Use Case</h1>
		<p>Sally finds my web page during business hours, probably from an office desktop.<br>
			She is looking for a cheap candidate for the position, that doesn't have much<br>
			experience, but shows an enthusiasm for the technologies requisite and that<br>
			presents her with the least amount of risk.
