Nice job overall on this Milestone. Your sitemap, content strategy, and interaction flow are all good. Consider making your Contact elements proportionally larger on the mobile layout. Don't forget that a simple contact form is required, so plan on integrating one into your contact area. We'll use php and Swiftmailer for this.

Add Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to start development on your PWP.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
1. Get a good layout skeleton in place - grid system.
2. Add some basic CSS - padding, margin, bg images, colors, etc.
3. Add contact form to site.
4. Go over https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/php/email/ - add the composer.json and mailer.php files. We'll install Swiftmailer when you roll out to ASO.
